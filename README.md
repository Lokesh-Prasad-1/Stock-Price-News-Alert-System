# Stock-Price-News-Alert-System


**Tech Stack: Python, REST APIs (Alpha Vantage, NewsAPI), Twilio API, HTTP Requests, JSON handling

**Developed an automated stock monitoring and news alert system that tracks daily price changes of a target stock (e.g., Tesla).

Utilizes Alpha Vantage API to fetch and analyze daily stock prices, calculating percentage changes between consecutive days.

Integrates NewsAPI to retrieve recent news articles when significant price movement (>5%) occurs.

Employs Twilio API to send formatted news alerts as WhatsApp messages directly to the userâ€™s device for real-time updates.

Demonstrates advanced Python skills including API consumption with requests, JSON data parsing, conditional logic for business rules, and external service integration for notifications.
